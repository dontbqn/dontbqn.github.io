School project on going, adding github so I can afford to forget my USB key for the presentation.
Comments are both in french / english for the moment, it's only a prototype.

Future updates : 
  - change every images because since now I've been using people images without their consent.
  - javascript function to alert user when they try to navigate to a page when they're already in.
  - add searchbar feature 
  - add php program to extract content of the contact's form
  - ensure that the mobile version is correctly designed
